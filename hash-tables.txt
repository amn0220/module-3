1.What is a hash table?

Hash tables are like arrays that store values by linking them to unique keys.

2.What is hashing?

Hashing is when strings are converted into hash codes, or numerical indexes in the hash table.

3.How does a hash table store data?

Hash tables take in a key to associate with input data, converts the key into a hash code, and stores that key with its associated values. Each key can reference multiple values. For example, a company could have a customer info hash table in which the keys are the customer’s phone numbers and the values associated with each key could be the customers’ names, addresses, and maybe even whether they are in a rewards program with that company or not.

4. How are hash tables and objects different?

When using a hash table, data containing consistently formatted values are stored with identifiers. Objects can store a static number of various types of values.

5. Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following pieces of data:

-A list of pets and their unique names.

Hash table

-The name, age, and the birthday of your best friend.

Object

-The name and location of every company in a given city.

Hash table


-All of the books checked out from a library by a particular individual.

Hash table

-The primary and secondary phone numbers for a contact.

Object

6. Build a system that allows a sales associate to enter a customer's name, address, and phone number into the system and look up customers using their phone numbers. Store this information in a hash table.

function createCustomerInfo (name, address, phoneNumber){
	CREATE HashMapName 
	CREATE HashMapAddress 
	CREATE HashMapPhoneNumber
	STORE phoneNumber (key) with name and address (values)
}

function lookupCustomer(phoneNumber){
	IF customer does NOT have phoneNumber
           PRINT ’New customer needs to be created’
	ELSE IF customer has phoneNumber
	   RETURN customer information
        ELSEcustomer phoneNumber doesn’t match
	   PRINT ‘Customer profile doesn’t exist’
        END IF
}
7. Build a system that allows a store owner to track their store's inventory using a hash table for storage.

function createInventory(itemName, itemId, inStock){
	CREATE HashMapInventory
	STORE itemId (key) in HashMapInventory with itemName and inStock status (values)
}

function trackInventory(itemId){
	IF itemId is in HashMapInventory 
	   RETURN itemName and inStock status
	ELSE 
	   PRINT ’The itemName doesn’t exist’
        END IF
}
8. Build a system that allows digital copies of newspapers to be entered and searched by publisher and publication date. Use hash tables to store the necessary data.

function enterDigitalNewspaper(publisher, publicationDate){
	CREATE HashMapNewspaper with publisher and publicationDate for each digital copy
	STORE publicationDate (key) with publisher (value) per copy in HashMapNewspaper
}

function searchNewspaper(publicationDate){
	IF  publicationDate is in HashMapNewspaper
	   RETURN publicationDate and publisher
	ELSE
	   PRINT ‘publicationDate was not found’
	END IF
}
