#Short Answer
1.Why do programmers use pseudocode?

Programmers use pseudocode to plan out and brainstorm code without using an actual coding language.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

Nothing will happen because pseudocode is meant to be read by humans, not computers. So error messages might come up and functions won’t do anything.

#Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1.Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF the first number is greater than the second number 
	PRINT the first number
ELSE 
	PRINT the second number

2.Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

SET initial number to 1
FOR numbers starting at 1
	ADD 1 to each number 
	PRINT all numbers until the number is 100
ENDFOR


3.Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

SET phonebook to list of names and phone numbers
FOR phonebook entry starting at 0 index and less than phonebook length iterate through phonebook
IF entry is equal to phonebook item
	PRINT ‘Entry was found!’
END
IF NOT entry
	PRINT ‘Entry was not found!’
END

4.Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

var phonebook = ['ashley','213-555-5555','joshua','616-555-5555'];
function findEntry(entry) {
	for(var i = 0; i < phonebook.length; i++){
		if(entry === phonebook[i]){
            return 'Entry was found!';
		}
	}
	return 'Entry was not found!';
}
var entry = findEntry();
console.log(findEntry('james')); // 'Entry was not found!'
console.log(findEntry('ashley')); // 'Entry was found!'
